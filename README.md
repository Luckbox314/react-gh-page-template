# React + TypeScript + Vite + Github Pages

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
It also includes a Github Actions workflow to deploy the application to Github Pages.

## Getting started

To get started, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building the application

All changes uploaded to `main` branch will be automatically deployed to Github Pages.
